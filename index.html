  <h3> If You Could Label Me </h3>
  
  <p>
    It feels like Athena is about to burst out of my skull—or some other god, like the god of anger or the god of what-in-the-world-is-inside-you. </p>

<p> And I'd make my hand a constellation, and call it greek mythology, if hubris could make the gods take notice. </p>

<p> But rather I am small, enough to fear a whisper, to flinch at things that would burn before the gold chariot of the morning. </p>

<p> Right now, it is night. And my chest feels like affection rises against me. A roar of red dunes, flaming red eyes and her spear—is a weapon. Not a metaphor, I realize, as the blade cuts across my chest. And I know that this wound will ache. </p> 

    <p> Please, goddess, I flinch. Do not raise you hand like that. Please, <i>god</i>, may your mercy find virtue in someone. Save those around me—their affection for the worthy. Do not let it be wasted on one whose heart grew up so strangled.
